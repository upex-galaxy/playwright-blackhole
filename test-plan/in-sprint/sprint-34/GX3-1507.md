-   As a QA learner,
-   I want to test the **Buttons** with:
    -   Obtain elements and do actions
    -   upload & Download Button
    -   Validations
-   So that I can improve my testing skills for this scenario.

```feature
Download:

IF: The "download" button is selected.

THEN: The file must be downloaded into the "download" PC folder.

Choose file:

IF: The "choose file" button is selected.

THEN: The PC File Explorer is open in order to select and upload a file.

AND: The uploaded file must display the Name and Location.

TechNote: The button “Choose File” is the only one that must be used to upload files.
